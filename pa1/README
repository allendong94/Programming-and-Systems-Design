CERTIFY IT'S YOUR WORK

"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people, except for the the resources explicitly mentioned in the CS 455
Course Syllabus.  And I did not share my solution or parts of it with
other students in the course."

Initial below to "sign" the above statement:

----------------------------------------------
ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):
1. In CS 455 what code from the web are you allowed to use in your assignment solution, assuming you modify that
code once you get it? (No clue? Hint: Reread the syllabus.) Note: no need to mention the "starter files" for the
assignment in your answer.

The outside code resources students will be allowed to use in assignments for this class are limited to code written by the course staff for the purposes of helping students in the course, or code from the textbook for this course.

2. What is the probability of each of the three outcomes in a trial: two heads, one head and one tail, and two tails? Why
is one of them different than the other two?

 (1)P(two heads):25%; (2)P(two tails):25%; (3)P(one head and one tail):50%;
the reason P(one head and one tail) is higher is its probability equation is: 0.5*0.5+0.5*0.5; the other two's probability equation is 0.5*o.5;

3. Roughly how many trials do you need to do before you mostly get results within 1% of these probabilities? Do
several simulations using your program to determine an answer to this.

about 5000 trails.

4. Roughly how many trials can you do before it crashes with an overflow error? State the largest value you tried where
it still worked correctly, and one where it overflowed. You can get an idea of what general values to try by looking at
the limits on Java integers (see Section 4.1.1 of the text). Play around with your program to verify that it actually
works for very large values that are within the limits. Note: this kind of testing can sometimes turn up bugs, so it's
good to do. Warning: For very large values you may have to wait a fair amount of time before you get the results.

 the result is: 2147483647
